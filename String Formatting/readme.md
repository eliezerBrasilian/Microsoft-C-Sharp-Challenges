# Challenge: Format and display instructions

1. You may only use either the Console.WriteLine() or the Console.Write() method twice.
In other words, to complete this challenge, you can only create two instructions that actually print output to the console. If you need to print additional new lines or add any formatting, you must use what you've learned in this module to accomplish it.

1. Use character escape sequences, verbatim strings, unicode, and string interpolation to generate the output.
To complete this challenge, your code must produce the following output.

```bash
